He received his Ph.D. from Network and Information Security Lab (NISL) at Tsinghua University (advised by Professors Qi Li and Haixin Duan) in 2024. He was a visiting scholar at UC Irvine as a project specialist, working with Professor Zhou Li. Additionally, he is the author of the fast IPv6 network device scanner XMap, open-sourced on GitHub (360+ stars). He is also a member of the DataCon Expert Committee. His research interests include network security, protocol security, IPv6 security, DNS security, Internet measurement, network \u0026amp; protocol fuzzing, network vulnerability discovery \u0026amp; attack, and underground economy with 18 research papers. As the first author, he has published many research papers at all top-tier security conferences, including Oakland S\u0026amp;P (2), USENIX Security (1), CCS (1), NDSS (1), and other conferences like DSN. As the corresponding author and co-author, he also published multiple papers in top conferences like USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS, SIGMETRICS, and IMC. He also gets his presentations accepted by top industry security conferences like Black Hat (Asia, USA^2, and Europe). He likes to attend talks and workshops like IDS, OARC, and VehicleSec to share his research. He applied for 11 patents (1 authorized and 5 in checking as the first author). He has obtained over 200 CVE/CNVD/CNNVD vulnerability numbers for a variety of influential IPv6 and DNS vulnerabilities, which have impacted over 20 home router vendors and all DNS implementations and resolver vendors. He received acknowledgements and more than $17,100 rewards from those vendors, like Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Akamai; an Austria government CERT daily report; A Sweden government CERT weekly news; A Bournemouth University (BU) CERT news; 100+ news coverage by media such as BleepingComputer. He is working for the improvement of network protocols (related work has been referenced in RFC). He got multiple prizes, such as 1st prize of IPv6 Technology Application Innovation Competition, 2nd prize of GeekCon 2023 DAF Contest, National Scholarship, Wang Dazhong Scholarship, Tsinghua Outstanding Scholarship, Outstanding Graduate, and Extraordinary Hacker of GeekCon International 2024.\nRecent News [07/2024](Presentation) DNSBomb Attack accepted by DNS OARC 43, Congrats!

在IPv4网络空间中，网络扫描技术具备着巨大的应用前景，可以被用来完成大规模的测量研究工作，诸如多种协议部署的测量、僵尸网络行为的追踪、潜在网络漏洞的发现。然而，IPv6引入了海量的128位地址空间，使得传统的枚举遍历扫描技术变得不太可行。即便学术界已经针对性地提出了多种有效的IPv6终端地址发现方案，但这些方案仍受到扫描效率和精度的影响，并不能被直接采用来进行IPv6网络空间中的大规模测量研究。\n本工作从全新的扫描角度出发，提出了一种新型的IPv6网络扫描技术，用于发现位于网络拓扑中重要位置的IPv6网络边界设备，同时设计并实现了全新的IPv6网络扫描器：XMap，可被用来进行大规模的扫描探测工作。通过利用XMap，本工作在若干个运营商的网络环境下发现了数以千万计的IPv6网络边界设备，并对其暴露的关键网络服务进行了深入的安全分析。此外，利用XMap，本工作发现了一个普遍存在的通用型路由循环漏洞（影响数十家路由器厂商），申请到了多于109个漏洞编号，并向厂商提供了合理的披露和有效的修复方案。\n漏洞编号：CNVD/CNNVD/CVE

fast network scanner designed for performing Internet-wide IPv6 \u0026amp; IPv4 network research scanning.\nXMap is reimplemented and improved thoroughly from ZMap and is fully compatible with ZMap, armed with the “5 minutes” probing speed and novel scanning techniques. XMap is capable of scanning the 32-bits address space in under 45 minutes. With a 10 gigE connection and PF_RING, XMap can scan the 32-bits address space in under 5 minutes. Moreover, leveraging the novel IPv6 scanning approach, XMap can discover the IPv6 Network Periphery fast. Furthermore, XMap can scan the network space randomly with any length and at any position, such as 2001:db8::/32-64 and 192.168.0.1/16-20. Besides, XMap can probe multiple ports simultaneously.\nXMap operates on GNU/Linux, Mac OS, and BSD. XMap currently has implemented probe modules for ICMP Echo scans, TCP SYN scans, and UDP probes.\nWith banner grab and TLS handshake tool, ZGrab2, more involved scans could be performed.\nInstallation The latest stable release of XMap is version 1.0.0 and supports Linux, macOS, and BSD. We recommend installing XMap from HEAD rather than using a distro package manager (not supported yet).\nInstructions on building XMap from source can be found in INSTALL.\nUsage XMap GitHub.\nA guide to using XMap can be found in our GitHub Wiki.\nSimple commands and options to using XMap can be found in USAGE.\nPaper Fast IPv6 Network Periphery Discovery and Security Implications.\nAbstract. Numerous measurement researches have been performed to discover the IPv4 network security issues by leveraging the fast Internet-wide scanning techniques. However, IPv6 brings the 128-bits address space and renders brute-force network scanning impractical. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to enumerating active IPv6 hosts, limited by technique efficiency and probing accuracy, large-scale empirical measurement studies under the increasing IPv6 networks are infeasible now.\nTo fill this research gap, by leveraging the extensively adopted IPv6 address allocation strategy, we propose a novel IPv6 network periphery discovery approach. Specifically, XMap, a fast network scanner, is developed to find the periphery, such as a home router. We evaluate it on twelve prominent Internet service providers and harvest 52M active peripheries. Grounded on these found devices, we explore IPv6 network risks of the unintended exposed security services and the flawed traffic routing strategies. First, we demonstrate the unintended exposed security services in IPv6 networks, such as DNS, and HTTP, have become emerging security risks by analyzing 4.7M peripheries. Second, by inspecting the periphery’s packet routing strategies, we present the flawed implementations of IPv6 routing protocol affecting 5.8M router devices. Attackers can exploit this common vulnerability to conduct effective routing loop attacks, inducing DoS to the ISP’s and home routers with an amplification factor of \u0026gt;200. We responsibly disclose those issues to all involved vendors and ASes and discuss mitigation solutions. Our research results indicate that the security community should revisit IPv6 network strategies immediately.\nAuthors.
