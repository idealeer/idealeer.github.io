He belongs to the Network and Information Security Lab (NISL). He is a visiting scholar at UC Irvine as a project specialist, working with Professor Zhou Li. He is also working as a security research intern in Qi-An-Xin Technology Company. Additionally, he is the author of a fast IPv6 network device scanner XMap, open-sourced in GitHub. His research interests include network security, protocol security, IPv6 security, DNS security, and Internet measurement. As the first author, he has published many research papers in top security conferences like USENIX Security, NDSS, and DSN. As the co-author, he also published papers in top conferences like USENIX Security and SIGMETRICS. He likes to attend talks and workshops like IDS and OARC to share researches. He has obtained over 130 CVE/CNVD vulnerability numbers for a variety of influential IPv6 and DNS vulnerabilities, which impacted over 20 home router vendors and all DNS implementations and resolver vendors. He received acknowledgements and more than $8,000 rewards from those vendors like Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Akamai, and is working for the improvement of DNS protocols.\nRecent News [02/2023](Activity) I’ll attend OARC 40 in person.

fast network scanner designed for performing Internet-wide IPv6 \u0026amp; IPv4 network research scanning.\nXMap is reimplemented and improved thoroughly from ZMap and is fully compatible with ZMap, armed with the “5 minutes” probing speed and novel scanning techniques. XMap is capable of scanning the 32-bits address space in under 45 minutes. With a 10 gigE connection and PF_RING, XMap can scan the 32-bits address space in under 5 minutes. Moreover, leveraging the novel IPv6 scanning approach, XMap can discover the IPv6 Network Periphery fast. Furthermore, XMap can scan the network space randomly with any length and at any position, such as 2001:db8::/32-64 and 192.168.0.1/16-20. Besides, XMap can probe multiple ports simultaneously.\nXMap operates on GNU/Linux, Mac OS, and BSD. XMap currently has implemented probe modules for ICMP Echo scans, TCP SYN scans, and UDP probes.\nWith banner grab and TLS handshake tool, ZGrab2, more involved scans could be performed.\nInstallation The latest stable release of XMap is version 1.0.0 and supports Linux, macOS, and BSD. We recommend installing XMap from HEAD rather than using a distro package manager (not supported yet).\nInstructions on building XMap from source can be found in INSTALL.\nUsage XMap GitHub.\nA guide to using XMap can be found in our GitHub Wiki.\nSimple commands and options to using XMap can be found in USAGE.\nPaper Fast IPv6 Network Periphery Discovery and Security Implications.\nAbstract. Numerous measurement researches have been performed to discover the IPv4 network security issues by leveraging the fast Internet-wide scanning techniques. However, IPv6 brings the 128-bits address space and renders brute-force network scanning impractical. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to enumerating active IPv6 hosts, limited by technique efficiency and probing accuracy, large-scale empirical measurement studies under the increasing IPv6 networks are infeasible now.\nTo fill this research gap, by leveraging the extensively adopted IPv6 address allocation strategy, we propose a novel IPv6 network periphery discovery approach. Specifically, XMap, a fast network scanner, is developed to find the periphery, such as a home router. We evaluate it on twelve prominent Internet service providers and harvest 52M active peripheries. Grounded on these found devices, we explore IPv6 network risks of the unintended exposed security services and the flawed traffic routing strategies. First, we demonstrate the unintended exposed security services in IPv6 networks, such as DNS, and HTTP, have become emerging security risks by analyzing 4.7M peripheries. Second, by inspecting the periphery’s packet routing strategies, we present the flawed implementations of IPv6 routing protocol affecting 5.8M router devices. Attackers can exploit this common vulnerability to conduct effective routing loop attacks, inducing DoS to the ISP’s and home routers with an amplification factor of \u0026gt;200. We responsibly disclose those issues to all involved vendors and ASes and discuss mitigation solutions. Our research results indicate that the security community should revisit IPv6 network strategies immediately.\nAuthors.
